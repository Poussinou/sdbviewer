# Song Database Viewer

The Song Database is a program to show lyrics on a digital projector for worship in a congregation.
This app can display the data produced by Song Database if it is accessible via a URL (web address).
It cannot be used for anything else, so if you don't use Song Database, this probably isn't for you!

If you find a bug or want a new feature, you are welcome to fix things yourself - 
or file an issue in the [GitHub project](https://github.com/mathisdt/sdbviewer/) (or at least drop me a line)!
